# Assignment 15.4: GUI Elements

# 1\. Narrative Text (TextMeshProUGUI)

# What it does: Shows story text line by line when the player clicks.

# 

# 

# Why I used it: TextMeshPro looks clean and is easy to format.

# 

# 

# Other options: Thought about using the old UI Text, but it’s lower quality.

# 

# 

# 2\. Next Button

# What it does: Lets the player go to the next line of text.

# 

# 

# Why I used it: Unity’s built-in Button is simple and works well with OnClick.

# 

# 

# Other options: Could have used a custom object, but Button was easier.

# 

# 

# 3\. Close Button

# What it does: Shows up after the last line and lets the player close the text box.

# 

# 

# Why I used it: Gives the player control and keeps the screen clean.

# 

# 

# Other options: Could hide the text automatically, but I wanted manual control.

# 

# 

# 

# 

# 

# 

# All GUI elements are placed under the Canvas.

# Everything works as expected.

# The Narrative Text includes visible text, which meets the assignment requirement.
